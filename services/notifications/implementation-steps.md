# Subscription Notifications Implementation Steps

## Current Status
✅ User Preferences Storage
- Notification preferences already implemented in user data store
- Includes notification toggle and reminder days setting

✅ Settings UI
- Notification controls already present in settings screen
- Includes toggle and reminder days preference

✅ Permission Management
- Created `permissions.ts` with comprehensive permission management:
  - `checkNotificationPermissions()`: Validates both system and user preferences
  - `validateNotificationStatus()`: Provides detailed status with reason
  - `getNotificationStatus()`: Gets granular permission state
- Integrated permission checks into reminder functions
- Added error handling and logging

✅ Subscription Management Integration
- Created `subscription-notifications.ts` with handlers for:
  - New subscription notifications
  - Subscription updates (with renewal date change detection)
  - Subscription deletion cleanup
- Integrated notification management into store actions:
  - Auto-schedule on subscription creation
  - Auto-update on subscription modification
  - Auto-cleanup on subscription deletion
- Added notification ID tracking in subscription data
- Implemented error handling and logging

✅ Notification State Management
- Created `state-management.ts` with handlers for:
  - Notification enable/disable state changes
  - Reminder days preference updates
  - Full notification rescheduling
- Integrated state management with store:
  - Automatic handling of notification toggle
  - Automatic handling of reminder days changes
  - Proper cleanup and rescheduling of notifications
- Added error handling and logging
- Implemented permission checks before state changes

## Remaining Implementation Steps

### 6. Error Handling & User Feedback
- Create error states for common scenarios:
  ```typescript
  type NotificationError = {
    type: 'PERMISSION_DENIED' | 'SCHEDULING_FAILED' | 'SYSTEM_LIMIT_REACHED';
    message: string;
    subscription?: SubscriptionItem;
  };
  ```
- Implement error handlers:
  - Permission denied: Guide users to system settings
  - Scheduling failures: Retry logic with max attempts
  - System limitations: Warn users when approaching notification limits
- Add user feedback components:
  - Toast messages for success/failure
  - In-app notifications for permission changes
  - Settings screen alerts for system limitations

## Integration Testing Checklist
- [ ] Test permission flows (grant/deny/revoke)
- [ ] Verify notification scheduling on subscription changes
- [ ] Validate preference change handlers
- [ ] Check error handling and user feedback
- [ ] Test system permission and user preference interactions
- [ ] Verify notification cancellation on subscription deletion
- [ ] Test reminder days change rescheduling
- [ ] Validate notification content and timing
